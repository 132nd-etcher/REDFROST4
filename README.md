#### Intel update from GFC staff

![gfc](GFC.png)

> The NAI's (Named Area of Interest) are location where we can expect to meet enemy forces:
  "3" might - if anything - host infantry recon (due to rough terrain)
  "1" and "2" might have heavier stuff (AT capabilities)
  All the others are good for just about anything

### Friendlies

Friendly TF "STINGER" stationned N of Tskhinvali.

TF STINGER composition: 1x Armored company (4x ABRAM+BRADLEY platoons) + 2x RECON/TACP vehicles (BRADLEYs).

### Setup

![overview](overview.png)

#### AKULA

Contact JTAC brutal when visual with FARP MADRID. Depending on situation, expect on of:

* land at MADRID for re-arm refule;
* push to the AO.

Akula flight to maintain GND to 5000ft.

#### BEAST

Establish HA ELISA.

Contact JTAC BRUTAL 35nm out of HA ELISA.

Advise BRUTAL  at initial contact if able to RTB for re-arm/refuel then come back at a later time.

#### MISTY

Establish HA WINONA.

Contact JTAC BRUTAL 35nm out of HA WINONA.

Advise BRUTAL  at initial contact if able to RTB for re-arm/refuel then come back at a later time.

### CAS

#### GRG

Both GRG are identical; at discretion FL.

![knee1](knee1.png)

#### AKULA

Once within AO, expect one of following COAs:
1. If time permits (STINGER is SOUTH of BELGIUM): AR C4 D4 E4 (GRG);
1. Otherwise: neutral escort posture STINGER;

Expect heavy use of FCMs; Northings only will be used (cfr. GRG).

#### MISTY

Once established HA WINONA, expect one of following COAs:

1. SEAD in support of AKULA and BEAST;
2. (or) attack pre-briefed targets acquired by JTAC BRUTAL during earlier phase;

Expect heavy use of FCMs; Northings only will be used (cfr. GRG).

Unless otherwise briefed, all attacks must be made from the WEST, egress to the SOUTH.

At WINCHESTER BEAST, MISTY to take over reactive CAS to support advance STINGER

#### BEAST

Once established HA ELISA, expect one of following COAs (in order of likeliness):

1. If time permits (STINGER is SOUTH of BELGIUM): CAS against pre-briefed targets acquired by JTAC BRUTAL during earlier phase;
1. If time permits (STINGER is SOUTH of BELGIUM): AR box formed by GRG grid B7 (NW corner) to E5 (SE corner);
1. Otherwise: reactive CAS to support advance STINGER.

Expect heavy use of FCMs; Northings only will be used (cfr. GRG).

Unless otherwise briefed, all attacks must be made from the EAST, egress to the SOUTH.
